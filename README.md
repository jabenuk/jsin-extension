# jSin: your average JavaScript injector

jSin is a simple work-in-progress, fully open-source JavaScript injector extension. It aims to be as simple and minimal as possible. **Currently only for Firefox.**

If you want a built-in text editor, use another extension instead - any other ones will be better than what I could make anyway. Unless someone else who knows what they're doing wants to contribute and add a text editor page (which I would welcome), that idea will not be implemented. Besides, I recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) instead.
